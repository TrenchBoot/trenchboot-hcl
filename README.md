# TrenchBoot Hardware Compatibility List

HCL reports for the [TrenchBoot Project](https://trenchboot.org/).

## Hardware requirements

In order to have a slight chance of success, you must meet the minimum
[hardware requirements](https://trenchboot.org/user-docs/requirements/).
They will be briefly described here. The goal of this section is not to
describe all of the requirements and details about them. It focuses on the most
important ones and easiest to check by a regular user.

### TPM

You need a
[Trusted Platform Module (TPM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module)
of some sort. It may come as a discrete module attached to the board (dTPM), or
as a firmware TPM (fTPM). Usually it's configurable in BIOS settings and
enabled by default. In case of no TPM being detected by the tools, check the
BIOS settings.

### CPU

#### AMD

There are no prerequisites to check.
[AMD Zen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)) or newer CPUs
will likely not work in the current stage of development. Refer to
[this issue](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues/issues/66) for
further progress on this.

#### Intel

1. Identify the model of your CPU by any means available:

  - physical inspection
  - Windows (e.g. `My Computer`)
  - Linux (e.g. `lscpu`) command

1. Go to [Intel Products page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/overview.html)
   and enter the CPU model name in the search bar (`e.g. i5-8500T`)
1. Check whether the ` IntelÂ® Trusted Execution Technology ` in `Security &
   Reliability` table is marked as `Yes`. If you cannot find such entry, your
   CPU does not support `TXT`, and you will not be able to use TrenchBoot.
1. Go into the BIOS settings of your machine and look for the
   `Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)` option. It is usually disabled and must
   be enabled first.
1. With this set of preparation, you are good to try the HCL tools to see if
   your system is applicable for TrenchBoot.

## Contributing

### Preparation

1. Go into
   [meta-trenchboot releases](https://github.com/zarhus/meta-trenchboot/releases)
   and download the latest image.
1. [Flash](https://github.com/zarhus/meta-trenchboot?tab=readme-ov-file#flash)
   the image to USB stick.
1. [Boot](https://github.com/zarhus/meta-trenchboot?tab=readme-ov-file#booting)
   the image.
1. Select `Boot Linux with TrenchBoot`
   - login as: `root`
   - execute `trenchboot-hcl-report` command
1. Select `Boot Linux with Xen (EFI)`
   - login as: `root`
   - execute `trenchboot-hcl-report` command

You may either hava a `Success` (entry booted into Linux prompt), or a `Failed`
(typicaly rebooted into GRUB auomatically) test case. Please refer to the
explanation below.

### Success cases

By `Success` cases cases we mean those resulting in booting TrenchBoot
entries into Linux login prompt. If it fails to boot (e.g. platform reboots
automatically after selection), please refer to the next section.

> **Note:** A bunch of `error: SINIT ACM does not match platform.` or similar
> errors appearing on the screen after you select boot menu entry is still
> considered a success, as long as `Press any key to continue...` appears, and
> you will be able to boot into Linux prompt after that action.

Send a Pull Request with resulting `.yml` file and (optionally) `.cpio.gz` file
to this repository. The desired directory structure is automatically created by
the reporting tool.

### Failed cases

The failure will usually result in a platform automatically rebooting after
selecting one of the `TrenchBoot` boot entries.

#### AMD

> The directory structure must be altered manually right now. We cannot detect
> that the previous attempt was failed, as we do with Intel TXT.

- enter `Boot Linux normally` boot menu entry
- login as: `root`
- execute `trenchboot-hcl-report` command
- send a Pull Request with resulting `.yml` file and (optionally) `.cpio.gz`
file to: `<version>/failure/linux` or `<version>/failure/xen` directory in
this repository, depending on which of the options failed to boot

#### Intel

In such a case:
- **important** - do not reboot or otherwise power cycle the platform by
  yourself; if you do, select the failing entry once again, and simply wait for
  the platform to reboot by itself
- enter `Boot Linux normally` boot menu entry
- login as: `root`
- execute `trenchboot-hcl-report` command
  - at this point, the tool should detect that the previous attempt failed
  (Intel TXT error detected), and will suggest reporting a failure

Send a Pull Request with resulting `.yml` file and (optionally) `.cpio.gz` file
to this repository. The desired directory structure is automatically created by
the reporting tool.
